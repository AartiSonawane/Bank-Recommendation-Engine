Recommendation systems enhances the customer engagement by not only providing higly appealing offers to the customer but also by adopting targeted marketing and advertising efforts towards potential customer segments. This is a win-win to both the Customer and to the service provider, thereby achieving cost efficiency. The objective of this analysis is to look at customer purchasing behavior of financial products at a Bank and predict the new products that customers are likely to purchase thereby recommending those products to the customers. With a more effective recommendation system in place, the bank can better meet the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction. Different data mining classification algorithms are tried and compared to identify the best model for such a problem.
